## Conventions

| Thing | Rule |
|---|---|
| Language | `lang=en` for English names, `lang=ms` for Malay. Default is Chinese — always pass it. |
| Time zone | `tz` takes an IANA name (`Asia/Manila`, `Europe/London`). Default `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`. It decides which calendar day a match belongs to. |
| Timestamps | ISO 8601 in UTC (`2026-09-25T16:00:00Z`). Convert before telling anyone a kick-off time. |
| Probabilities | Fractions 0–1 for `home`, `draw`, `away`; they sum to 1. Show as percentages with one decimal. |
| Rates | `hitRate` is already a percentage (57.9 means 57.9%) of matches where the model's most likely outcome happened. `null` means the sample is under `minBucketSample` (30) or empty — report the count instead. |
| Baselines | `market`: always take the pre-match favourite. `random`: one outcome in three. Same matches, same counting. |
| Bad parameters | An unparseable `date` / `week_start` silently falls back to the current day / week. Check the echoed value. |

## /record/daily

`GET /record/daily?lang=en&tz=Asia/Kuala_Lumpur&date=2026-09-26`

One calendar day in `tz`. `date` defaults to today.

```json
{
  "date": "2026-09-26",
  "tz": "Asia/Kuala_Lumpur",
  "ledgerStart": "2026-10-10",
  "upcoming": [],
  "finished": [
    {
      "matchId": "6327698412",
      "kickoffAt": "2026-09-25T16:00:00Z",
      "leagueKey": "欧国联",
      "league": "UEFA Nations League",
      "homeTeam": "Armenia",
      "awayTeam": "Latvia",
      "probabilities": { "home": 0.5367, "draw": 0.2511, "away": 0.2122 },
      "confidence": 0.583,
      "homeScore": 2,
      "awayScore": 0,
      "actual": "home",
      "hit": true,
      "source": "auto",
      "capturedAt": "2026-09-25T14:01:49Z"
    }
  ],
  "day": {
    "n": 17, "hits": 9, "hitRate": 52.9,
    "market": { "n": 17, "hits": 9, "hitRate": 52.9 },
    "random": { "n": 17, "hits": 6, "hitRate": 33.3 }
  },
  "cumulative": {
    "n": 0, "hits": 0, "hitRate": null,
    "market": { "n": 0, "hits": 0, "hitRate": null },
    "random": { "n": 0, "hits": 0, "hitRate": 33.3 }
  }
}
```

- `upcoming` — readings captured, no final score yet. A match enters this list 45–120 minutes before
  kick-off and leaves it when the score arrives, so it may already be in play. Matches further out are
  not listed anywhere yet.
- `finished` — readings with their final score.
- `day` — how that day's finished readings went, beside the two baselines.
- `cumulative` — the running total of the official ledger, which starts on `ledgerStart`
  (2026-10-10). Before that date it is empty by design; use `/record/summary` for the record so far.

## /record/weekly

`GET /record/weekly?lang=en&tz=Asia/Kuala_Lumpur&week_start=2026-09-21`

Monday-to-Sunday week in `tz`; `week_start` defaults to the current week's Monday.

Top-level fields: `weekStart`, `weekEnd`, `n`, `hits`, `hitRate`, `market`, `random`, `buckets` (same
shape as in the summary, usually `null` rates because a single week is small), `matches` (array of
[match objects](#the-match-object)), `biggestMiss` (the highest-confidence reading that did not
happen, or `null`), `cumulative` (as in daily).

```json
{
  "weekStart": "2026-09-21", "weekEnd": "2026-09-27",
  "n": 55, "hits": 38, "hitRate": 69.1,
  "market": { "n": 55, "hits": 38, "hitRate": 69.1 },
  "buckets": [
    { "key": "lt45", "n": 3, "hits": 1, "hitRate": null },
    { "key": "45to55", "n": 26, "hits": 15, "hitRate": null },
    { "key": "55to65", "n": 12, "hits": 10, "hitRate": null },
    { "key": "gte65", "n": 14, "hits": 12, "hitRate": null }
  ]
}
```

## /record/summary

`GET /record/summary`

Everything recorded since `since`, in one number and by confidence band. No `lang` needed — there are
no names in it.

```json
{
  "since": "2026-08-27",
  "until": "2026-09-27T00:30:00Z",
  "minBucketSample": 30,
  "n": 473, "hits": 274, "hitRate": 57.9,
  "market": { "n": 473, "hits": 272, "hitRate": 57.5 },
  "random": { "n": 473, "hits": 158, "hitRate": 33.3 },
  "buckets": [
    { "key": "lt45",   "n": 51,  "hits": 23, "hitRate": 45.1 },
    { "key": "45to55", "n": 202, "hits": 93, "hitRate": 46.0 },
    { "key": "55to65", "n": 110, "hits": 70, "hitRate": 63.6 },
    { "key": "gte65",  "n": 110, "hits": 88, "hitRate": 80.0 }
  ],
  "snapshots": { "auto": 55, "backfill": 418 },
  "lockedSince": "2026-09-20T17:09:02Z"
}
```

- Band keys are ranges of the `confidence` score, and the key spells the range: `ltNN` is below
  0.NN, `NNtoMM` is 0.NN up to 0.MM, `gteNN` is 0.NN and above (so `lt45` is below 0.45 and `gte65`
  is 0.65 and above). **The set of bands can change** — read them from the response rather than
  assuming the four shown here. A well-behaved record has higher rates in higher bands; say whether
  it does.
- `snapshots` — how many readings were captured before kick-off by the scheduled job (`auto`) versus
  reconstructed from history before the record page launched (`backfill`). `lockedSince` is when the
  scheduled capture started. Only `auto` readings prove they predate kick-off.

## /record/leagues

`GET /record/leagues?lang=en`

```json
{ "leagues": [
  { "key": "西甲", "name": "La Liga", "n": 50 },
  { "key": "英超", "name": "Premier League", "n": 35 },
  { "key": "美职联", "name": "MLS", "n": 10 }
] }
```

`n` is how many recorded matches the competition has. Use `key` (not `name`) as the `league` filter on
`/record/matches`. A competition that is not in this list is not covered.

## /record/matches

`GET /record/matches?lang=en&league=英超&result=miss&page=1&pageSize=20`

URL-encode the key (`league=%E8%8B%B1%E8%B6%85`). `result` is `all` (default), `hit` or `miss`.
`pageSize` is at most 100. Newest first.

Top-level fields: `total`, `page`, `pageSize`, `totalPages`, `filters`, `items` (array of
[match objects](#the-match-object)).

## The match object

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `matchId` | Stable id |
| `kickoffAt` | UTC kick-off |
| `league`, `leagueKey` | Display name in `lang`; filter key |
| `homeTeam`, `awayTeam` | Names in `lang` |
| `probabilities` | `{home, draw, away}`, fractions summing to 1 |
| `confidence` | 0–1 score used for the bands. Not a probability. |
| `homeScore`, `awayScore` | Final score, `null` until finished |
| `actual` | `home` / `draw` / `away`, `null` until finished |
| `hit` | Whether the highest of the three probabilities was the actual outcome; `null` until finished |
| `source` | `auto` (captured before kick-off by the scheduled job) or `backfill` (reconstructed) |
| `capturedAt` | When the reading was captured; meaningful for `auto` |
